Description: Provides functions to align curves and to compute mean curves based on the 
    elastic distance defined in the square-root-velocity framework. For more details on 
    this framework see Srivastava and Klassen (2016, <doi:10.1007/978-1-4939-4020-2>). 
    For more theoretical details on our methods and algorithms see 
    Steyer et al. (2021, <arXiv:2104.11039>).
